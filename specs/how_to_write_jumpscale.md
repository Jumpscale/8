We should aim to follow [pep8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) standard

## Code Conventions:
 - __Modules__ should have short, all-lowercase names. Underscores can be used in the module name if it improves readability.
 - __Class names__ should normally use the CapWords convention.
 - __Function names__ should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.
 - __Constants__ are usually defined on a module level and written in all capital letters with underscores separating words.
 - __Variables__ should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores.

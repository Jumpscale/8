We should aim to follow [pep8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) standard

## Code Conventions:
 - __Modules__ should have short, all-lowercase names. Underscores can be used in the module name if it improves readability.
 - __Class names__ should normally use the CapWords convention.
 - __Function names__ should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.
 - __Constants__ are usually defined on a module level and written in all capital letters with underscores separating words.
 - __Variables__ should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores.

## Docs:
  - __Docstrings__ should be defined on all methods and functions, unless immediately intuitive from name.
  - __Docs__ defined under `/docs/` of each repo.

## Testing:
 - For AYS:
 https://github.com/Jumpscale/ays9/blob/master/ays_testrunner/readme.md

 - For unit testing:

## Extending Prefab:
 TODO: define how a prefab module should look like.

## AYS:
  - See [here](https://github.com/Jumpscale/ays9/blob/master/docs/walkthroughs/Create_actor_template.md) how to create an AYS templates
  - add README.md next to it describing all its config params and an example blueprint.
